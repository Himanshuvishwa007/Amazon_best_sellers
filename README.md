# 📊 Amazon Best Seller Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis

Welcome to my EDA project on the **Amazon Best Seller Dataset**, where I explore patterns in product pricing, customer ratings, and country-level distributions. The aim is to extract meaningful insights that can be useful for understanding customer preferences, pricing strategies, and regional trends.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes various attributes such as:

- `product_title` — Name of the software product
- `product_price` — Price of the product in USD
- `product_star_rating` — Average customer star rating
- `product_num_ratings` — Number of customer reviews
- `rank` — Bestseller ranking
- `country` — Country where the product is listed

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- Understand price distributions and identify outliers
- Analyze how ratings correlate with price and popularity
- Identify most popular products and country-level patterns
- Clean and prepare data for potential machine learning applications

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Price Trends:** Most products are priced below $100, but some premium listings reach up to $80,000.
- **Ratings vs. Price:** No strong correlation — expensive products don’t always have better ratings.
- **Country Distribution:** Germany and the US dominate the listings; some countries show unusual pricing variance.
- **Most Reviewed Products:** Microsoft 365 and McAfee lead with thousands of reviews, indicating high trust and demand.
- **Rating vs. Review Count:** Products with 4.0–4.8 ratings attract the most reviews; some low-rated items still receive high engagement.
